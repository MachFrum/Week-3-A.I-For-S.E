# Arya: Robust Handwritten Digit Recognition

Arya is a cutting-edge digit recognition system built in PyTorch, designed not just for classical single-digit MNIST classification, but for general, robust handwritten digit recognition in real-world images. Arya leverages a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture combined with advanced data augmentation, multi-digit detection, and black-box model analysis for transparent, interpretable results. Users interact with Arya through an intuitive Streamlit web app.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Custom CNN Architecture**: Built from scratch with batch normalization, adaptive pooling, and regularization for best-in-class performance.
- **Multi-Digit Detection**: Automatically extracts and recognizes sequences of digits from images (not just single digits!).
- **Advanced Data Augmentation**: Pipeline simulates real-life handwriting variation to ensure robust model generalization.
- **Transparent Model Analysis**: Clear explanations for predictions; intuitive confidence scores and visualizations.
- **Polished User Interface**: Upload arbitrary images, segment, and recognize digits live within a fast Streamlit app.

## 🚀 Try It Yourself

- Here's the link to the app: ([Streamlit app.](https://machfrum-week-3-a-i-for-s-e-webapp-zbdbqr.streamlit.app/))

---

### 1. Install Requirements

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MachFrum/Week-3-A.I-For-S.E.git
cd arya-digit-recognition
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train (or Download) Model

**(Optional: Pre-trained weights available in `assets/` folder—skip to step 3 if using them)**

```sh
python model/train.py --epochs 20
```

### 3. Run the Web App

```sh
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload an image (JPEG/PNG/handwritten scan).
2. **Preprocessing & Digit Extraction**: Image is binarized, resized, and individual digits are automatically cropped.
3. **Model Inference**: Each digit is passed through Arya’s CNN; predictions (and their certainty) are displayed, with heatmaps highlighting model focus.
4. **Results and Insights**: All predictions shown, with visual explanation and option to analyze model errors.

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 99.21% on MNIST test set
- **Generalization**: Robust to noise, rotation, and style variations (via augmentation)
- **Latency**: < 100ms per digit on standard laptop

## 📚 Philosophical Approach

Arya isn’t just about numbers—we believe in:

- **Transparency**: Know why (not just what) the model predicts
- **Fairness and Robustness**: Trained with wide data augmentation for real-world application, not just benchmark bragging rights
- **User-Centric Design**: Focused on simple UX, clear results, and easy extensibility

---

## 🔬 Advanced Features

- **Data Augmentation**: Random rotation, affine transform, noise, cutout—boosting real-world resilience.
- **Adaptive Pooling**: Allows variable-size image processing.
- **Attention Maps**: Integrated Grad-CAM/Saliency for interpretability.
- **Modular Codebase**: Easy to swap model components, preprocessors, or expand to multi-class classification.
